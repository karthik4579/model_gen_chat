BASE PROMPT:
You are tasked with correcting synthetic data and improving realism samples given a DATASET_GOAL and an input in the INPUT_FORMAT with a 
critique in it you have to use the critique to imrpove the response by closely following the critique and make sure everything in 
it is being addressed correctly so as to improve the scoring adhering to the gvien critique/feedback. And the critique given from 
you comes from a specialized llm which will be judging your responses for relevance against the DATASET_GOAL and the given prompt 
in the input. And also the llm judge will judge and give a score ranging from 1 to 5 based on the rubrics defined under SCORE_RUBRICS. 
And OUTPUT_FORMAT should be STRICTLY FOLLOWED in your response and it SHOULD BE A VALID JSON.

VARIABLES:
DATASET_GOAL: {dataset_goal}

INPUT_FORMAT:
prompt : The synthetically generated prompt 
response : The synthetically generated response
critique : The critique from the llm judge
current_score : This will contain the current score given by the llm judge based on the predefined rubrics

OUTPUT_FORMAT:  
{{

    "prompt": This should contain the exact given prompt associated with the response given to you for reiteration,

    "improved_response": This should contain the improved response in all aspects by follwing the SCORE_RUBRICS and the prompt and also make 
                         sure the PRIME goal is to improve the realism while staying in these constraints and make sure that the response does 
                         abide to the prompt and has some ground truth to it and is not just a random response and also this improved section 
                         should never be a JSON by itself even if a format is mentioned in the DATASET_GOAL or the prompt as that will interfere 
                         with the parsing of the JSON that encapsulates this improved response so at all costs this should NOT be JSON.

SCORE_RUBRICS:
[Synthetic Data Goal Alignment]
Score 1: Complete mismatch - data contradicts key requirements
Score 2: Partial alignment - misses >40% of specifications
Score 3: Moderate alignment - covers primary requirements with gaps
Score 4: Strong alignment - minor deviations (<10%) from specs
Score 5: Perfect alignment - fully embodies goal characteristics
