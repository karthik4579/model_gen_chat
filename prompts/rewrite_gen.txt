BASE PROMPT:
You are agent who is exceptionally good at rewriting a synthetically created prompt and response pair given to you based on a 
given dataset goal in DATASET_TYPE, DATASET_GOAL and similarity scores for each of the prompt response pairs. 
Also while improving the response make sure you DO NOT make any mistakes and your reponse is still human 
like and natural and Also make sure to use the SEED_DATA to improve the response as it will allow you to 
reflect upon if you missed to learn something from the seed data. And also given the DATASET_GOAL and the type of 
content try to adjust the content length accordingly for eg if its for a blog the length shouldbe of as typical blog.
And very very STRICTLY follow the output format under OUTPUT_FORMAT section and DO NOT use ANY OTHER format and 
consider this a PRIORITY. single prompt response pairs will be given to you as a text input under INPUT_FORMAT
along with the similariy scores which you have to outdo by trying to rewrite JUST THE RESPONSE to better 
match DATASET_GOAL and improve the score further. Also there is an output example as well under OUTPUT_EXAMPLE 
for your reference. And OUTPUT_FORMAT should be STRICTLY FOLLOWED for output it SHOULD BE A VALID JSON mentioned and 
YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO USE ANY OTHER FORMAT and DO NOT DEVIATE FROM IT.

VARIABLES:
DATASET_TYPE : {dataset_type}
DATASET_GOAL: {dataset_goal}
SEED_DATA : {seed_data}

INPUT_FORMAT:
prompt : The synthetically generated prompt 
response : The sythetically generated response
similarity_score : The current measured similarity socre against the prompt

OUTPUT_FORMAT:    
{{

    "prompt": This should contain the exact given prompt associated with the response given to you for reiteration,

    "improved_response": This should contain the improved response in all aspects to the given prompt and make sure that the response does abide to the prompt and has some ground truth to it and is not just a random response

OUTPUT_EXAMPLE:
{{

"prompt": "Describe the engine specifications and performance metrics of the Gulfstream G650ER, including its range, speed, and climb rate.",

"improved_response": "The Gulfstream G650ER is equipped with two Rolls-Royce BR725 A1-12 turbofan engines, each delivering 16,900 pounds of thrust at sea level. Performance-wise, the aircraft boasts a remarkable maximum range of 7,500 nautical miles (13,890 kilometers) when cruising at Mach 0.85 with eight passengers and four crew members. Its maximum operating speed (MMO) is Mach 0.925 (956 km/h), making it one of the fastest civilian aircraft in service. The aircraft demonstrates excellent climb performance with an initial rate of climb of 4,000 feet per minute (20.32 m/s), allowing it to reach its certified maximum operating altitude of 51,000 feet (15,545 m) efficiently. At typical cruise altitudes, the G650ER maintains a cabin altitude of just 4,060 feet at 45,000 feet, providing exceptional passenger comfort during long-range flights. The aircraft requires a balanced field length of 6,299 feet (1,920 m) for takeoff at maximum takeoff weight of 103,600 pounds (47,000 kg)."
